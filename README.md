# GMATCH
Greedy matching can be used in case-control 1:N matching for epidemiological studies. However, I am having trouble with the 'remove of 1:N-1 matched case' in the original SAS code, which can be found at the URL below for exact matching. If you are experiencing the same issue, you can use the code to solve it.
